Zeus2Q code was created as open source and we are sharing this code with everyone. The code works best with costume board we create. 


We have developed our own control board. The Humanoid Robot Control Board offers a reliable connection between the battery and the Servos, providing up to 10 amps of power. It features (2) 18 ports for controlling the main Mini Maestro Servo. The board also includes a 5V power converter for powering additional components. A custom designed controller board can offer advantages such as better performance, greater flexibility, and lower cost compared to using multiple off-the-shelf components. They can also be tailored to meet specific requirements, such as the number and type of inputs and outputs, communication protocols, and processing power.
